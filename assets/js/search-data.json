            "content": "Japan is no stranger to earthquakes. The island itself is located at the converging point of four techtonic plates. As a result, the area experiences around 1,000 earthquakes a year, averaging about 3 a day. Most of these quakes go without any notice, the majority being below magnitude 5, but there is always the chance for much bigger quakes to occur. . Interactive Map of Earthquakes near Japan. Made with Folium . A magnitude 9.1 earthquake is an incredibly rare event in any part of the world and, according to the official position of the US Geological Survey, it is impossible to predict both time and location of such an event before it happens. This doesn&#39;t mean the probability of such an event can&#39;t be calculated though. The Gutenberg-Richter law states that the relationship between the magnitude of an earthquake and the logarithm of the probability that it happens is linear, so we can estimate the likeihood of such an event happening by creating a linear model . The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident . I&#39;ve read online that during the safety analysis, the engineers at Fukushima used historical earthquake data dating back to 1600 CE to build a regression model to determine the likelihood of significant earthquakes. Instead of using the accepted Gutenberg-Richter model, they saw a kink in the data and assumed the appropriate regression was not linear but polynomial. The resulting model assumed that a magnitude 9 and above earthquake was essentailly impossible, occuring once within a 19,000 year period. . . I haven&#39;t found much evidence to support this other than a few sources such as Berkeley Machine Learning Crash Course which cites a paper by Brian Stacey titled Fukushima: The Failure of Predictive Models which then cites Nate Silver&#39;s book, The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — but Some Don&#39;t and a report by M.Ragheb titled FUKUSHIMA EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI STATION BLACKOUT ACCIDENT . What I can tell is that the station was not designed to widthstand a magnitude 9 earthquake. The 3/11 earthquakes produced a tsunami towering more than 14 meters (46 feet). The safety design team desgined the plan to be able to widthstand a magnitude 8.6, which would have generated a tsunami 5.7 meters tall, so the tsunami was easily able to breach the 6 meter tall seawall surrounding the plant. . . The assuption that these types of quakes were impossible wasn&#39;t uncommon. Emile Okal, a earthquake and tsunami expert explains some of the rational. . Essentially, the feeling was that — if you had a very, very old ocean floor — when it was eventually recycled into the mantle of the Earth, you wouldn’t get these mega-earthquakes. . In his book, Nate Silver uses data from January 1st, 1964 to March 11th, 2011 to recreate a similar polynomial model that the safety engineers have assumed to have used. Nate uses data from the US Geological Survey and pulls a 1 degree by 1 degree box of data around the origin of the 3/11 earthquake.

As a fun exercise, I recreated the style that Nate Silver used in his book. Below is the code to generate the scatter plot. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) df_freq.reset_index().plot.scatter(x = &#39;Magnitude&#39;, y =&#39;Yearly Frequency&#39;, logy=True, ax = ax, color = &#39;k&#39;, s = 250, marker = &#39;D&#39;, clip_on=False) plt.xticks(np.arange(4.5,9.6,0.5), size = 20) plt.yticks(size=20) ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ticker.FuncFormatter(lambda y,pos: (&#39;{{:.{:1d}f}}&#39;.format(int(np.maximum(-np.log10(y),0)))).format(y))) ax.tick_params(width = 1, length = 10, which = &#39;major&#39;) ax.tick_params(width = 0, length = 0, which = &#39;minor&#39;) ax.tick_params(width = 1, length = 10, which = &#39;major&#39;) ax.tick_params(width = 0, length = 0, which = &#39;major&#39;, axis = &quot;x&quot;) plt.hlines(1,0,10, color = &#39;k&#39;) plt.xlim(4.5,9.5) plt.ylim(0.0001,1000) plt.grid(linestyle=&quot;--&quot;, linewidth = 2.5, alpha = 0.3) plt.ylabel(&quot;Annual Frequency: nEarthquakes of at least this magnitude&quot;, size = 20) plt.xlabel(&quot;Magnitude&quot;,size = 20) [ax.spines[i].set_visible(False) for i in [&#39;top&#39;,&#39;bottom&#39;,&#39;right&#39;]] plt.suptitle(f&quot;{&#39;TŌHOKU, JAPAN EARTHQUAKE FREQUENCIES&#39;} n{&#39;JANUARY 1, 2001-MARCH 10,2011&#39;:&lt;45}&quot;, size = 20, x = 0.2, y = 1); . The chart doesn&#39;t exactly match Nate&#39;s due to the dataset being a shorter time time period (2000-2011) but it&#39;s a close enough match to create a linear model. . lm = LinearRegression() X = np.array(df_freq.reset_index()[&#39;Magnitude&#39;]).reshape(-1,1) y = np.log10(df_freq[&#39;Yearly Frequency&#39;]) s = df_freq[&#39;Yearly Frequency&#39;] lm.fit(X,y,s) pred = 10 ** lm.predict(np.arange(0,11,1).reshape(-1,1)) . The resulting model is a good approximation to Nate&#39;s with the estimated likihood of a magnitude earthquake happening once every 800 years while Nates&#39;s linear model predicts an event every 900 years. . . Polynomial . Since I can&#39;t find too much info on the polynomial model, but the closest, least complicated model that can match Nate&#39;s polynomial model is b4 mag^4 + b3 mag^3 + b2 mag^2 + b1 mag + b0. This model produces the following graph. . .",

            "content": "Full Disclosure . I don&#39;t believe that there is any way to reliably predict stock prices movements. This is just an experiment to see if any signals can be extracted from seemingly random movements in a time series. Past performance is not indicative of future results. . I also am aware that there are libraries that can generate the plots and data I need much more efficiently. This post is more of an exercise for my programming skills rather than a demonstration of how to do things in a more efficient manner. . Collecting the Data . There are a few libraries that we can use for a project like this. One of them is yfinance, which pulls data from Yahoo Finance and, until recently, Google Finance as well. It seems like both Yahoo and Google aren&#39;t fans of their services being hijacked by these libraries though since yfinance breaks all the time due to system changes by Yahoo and Google. As of writing this blog, loading historical stock data via yfinance using Yahoo Finance is not working. . Instead of relying on a library to pull our data, we can build our own function to pull data from Yahoo Finance using their historical data page. There is an option in Yahoo to download data as a CSV object, so all we need to do is build our URL and pass it into pandas to get our data . def load_historical_stock_data(ticker:str, start = &quot;1900-01-01&quot;, end = datetime.today().strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;), interval = &#39;1d&#39;): # Convert string time to datetime start = datetime.strptime(start, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) end = datetime.strptime(end, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) # Calculate second since epoch start = int((start - datetime(1970,1,1)).total_seconds()) end = int((end - datetime(1970,1,1)).total_seconds()) # I like to format my urls like this, it feels cleaner # The new lines add which spaces, so that&#39;s what replace is for url = f&quot;https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/ {ticker}? period1={start}&amp; period2={end}&amp; interval={interval}&amp; events=history&amp; includeAdjustedClose=true&quot;.replace(&quot; &quot;,&quot;&quot;) return (pd.read_csv(url) .astype({&#39;Date&#39;:&#39;datetime64&#39;}) .set_index(&#39;Date&#39;) ) .

Data Visualizations . It&#39;s always fun to generate plots with our data. It&#39;s a great way to find patterns, missing values, and other anomalies we might not expect. Since stock prices are constantly changing minute-to-minute, the data is typically plotted in candle-stick notation. The open and close prices are shown as the height of the candle and the color notates the direction of the stocks movement. There aren&#39;t any great libraries to generate these plots either, so we can summarize our data by grouping it and using our function below to plot our candlestick chart. . def candle_plotter(df, ax): # Generate a psuedo plot for overlay ax.plot(df.index, df.Close, alpha = 0) # Get the start and end values for the axis start, end = ax.get_xlim() start_y, end_y = ax.get_ylim() # Figure out what width the candles should be based on those start and end values vs the length of the df candle_width = ((end-start)/len(df))/2 # Generate the wick width hl_width = candle_width / 15 volume_max_height = (end_y - start_y)/10 for ind, row in df.iterrows(): # Colors for the candles color = &#39;green&#39; if row[&#39;Close&#39;] &lt; row[&#39;Open&#39;]: color = &#39;red&#39; # Starting position of the candle oc_ind = mdates.date2num(ind) # Starting position of the wick # candle start + half of candle width for center then offset for width of wick hl_ind = (oc_ind + (candle_width/2)) - (hl_width/2) # candle rect open_close = patches.Rectangle((oc_ind, row[&#39;Open&#39;]), candle_width, row[&#39;Close&#39;]-row[&#39;Open&#39;], linewidth=1, edgecolor=color, facecolor=color, fill=True) # wick rect high_low = patches.Rectangle((hl_ind, row[&#39;Low&#39;]), hl_width, row[&#39;High&#39;]-row[&#39;Low&#39;], linewidth=1, edgecolor=&#39;black&#39;, facecolor=&#39;black&#39;, fill=True) # volume vol = patches.Rectangle((oc_ind, start_y), candle_width, volume_max_height * (row[&#39;Volume&#39;]/df[&#39;Volume&#39;].max()), linewidth=1, #edgecolor=&#39;cornflowerblue&#39;, facecolor=&#39;cornflowerblue&#39;, fill=True) ax.add_patch(vol) ax.add_patch(high_low) ax.add_patch(open_close) ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(&#39;${x:1.2f}&#39;) return df . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) (df .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;3m&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .tail(4*3*100) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax) ) plt.grid(True) plt.title(ticker) #plt.yscale(&#39;log&#39;) plt.show() . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) (df .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;w&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .tail(30) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax) ) plt.grid(True) plt.title(ticker) #plt.yscale(&#39;log&#39;) plt.show() .

Feature Engineering . Moving Averages . Some of the most popular indicators for predicting stock prices are moving averages. Moving averages take the last n observations of a stock and average them together. This helps remove some noise from the signal. If a shorter term moving average crosses over a longer term moving average, some believe that the stock has signalled a downturn. . Simple Weighted Moving Average . The most basic of these moving aveages is the simple moving average. The most commonly used are the 200 day moving average and the 50 day moving average. . We can easily generate those values for the stock of our choice by using the .rolling() method in pandas. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1,figsize=(16,9)) (df .assign(MA_50 = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].rolling(50).mean()) .assign(MA_200 = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].rolling(200).mean()) .tail(3*365) .pipe(plotter, &#39;MA_50&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39;, linewidth = 2) .pipe(plotter, &#39;MA_200&#39;, color = &#39;red&#39;, linewidth = 2 ) .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;1m&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax) ) plt.title(f&quot;{ticker} with MA200 and MA50&quot;) plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show(); . Exponentially Weighted Moving Average . Exponential moving averages, like simple moving averages, are designed to see price trends over specific time frames. Compared to simple moving averages, EMAs give greater weight to recent data by adding a multiplier to the simple moving average calculation. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1,figsize=(16,9)) (df .assign(EMA_50 = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].ewm(span = 50).mean()) .assign(EMA_200 = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].ewm(span = 200).mean()) .tail(3*365) .pipe(plotter, &#39;EMA_50&#39;, color = &#39;purple&#39;, linewidth = 2) .pipe(plotter, &#39;EMA_200&#39;, color = &#39;blue&#39;, linewidth = 2) .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;1m&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax) ) plt.title(f&quot;{ticker} with EMA200 and EMA50&quot;) plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show(); . Volume Weighted Moving Averages . A volume weighted moving average will weight each record by the volume, so heavier volume days will have more of an impact in the movement of the signal than other days. This typically matches up with the simple moving average with a few exceptions. More recently, Twitter has become a hot stock due to the talks of Elon Musk acquiring the social media site and taking the stock private. This sentiment caused a large spike in volume, which caused the volume weighted price to move much faster than the simple moving average. . def vwap(df, window = 50, q = &#39;Volume&#39;, p = &#39;Adj Close&#39;): q = df[q] p = df[p] return (p * q).rolling(window=window).sum()/q.rolling(window=window).sum() . twitter = &quot;TWTR&quot; twitter = load_historical_stock_data(twitter, start = &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) . fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1,figsize=(16,9)) (twitter .assign(VWAP_50 = lambda x: vwap(x)) .assign(MA_50 = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].rolling(50).mean()) .tail(365) .pipe(plotter, &#39;VWAP_50&#39;, color = &#39;purple&#39;, linewidth = 2) .pipe(plotter, &#39;MA_50&#39;, color = &#39;blue&#39;, linewidth = 2) .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;1w&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax) ) plt.title(&quot;Twitter Stock: Difference between Volume Weighted MA and Simple MA&quot;) plt.legend() plt.show() . Jurik Moving Average . def jurik(ser): pass . Oscillators . MACD . The Moving Average Convergence-Divergence is a value of an exponential moving average (EMA) subtracted from another EMA with a shorter lookback period. Common values are 26 days for the longer EMA and 12 for the shorter. . def macd_plotter(df, ax): ax.plot(df.index, df.Close, alpha = 0) start, end = ax.get_xlim() candle_width = ((end-start)/len(df)) for ind, row in df.iterrows(): color = &#39;green&#39; if row[&#39;MACD&#39;] &lt; 0: color = &#39;red&#39; oc_ind = mdates.date2num(ind) open_close = patches.Rectangle((oc_ind, 0), candle_width, row[&#39;MACD&#39;], linewidth=1, edgecolor=color, facecolor=color, fill=True) ax.add_patch(open_close) ax.set_ylim(df[&#39;MACD&#39;].min()*2,df[&#39;MACD&#39;].max()*2) df[&#39;MACD_H&#39;].plot(secondary_y=True, style=&#39;black&#39;, ax = ax) df[&#39;MACD_S&#39;].plot(secondary_y=True, style=&#39;orange&#39;, ax = ax) return df . fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(16,9), gridspec_kw={&#39;height_ratios&#39;: [2,1]}) (df .assign(k = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].ewm(span=12, adjust=False, min_periods=12).mean()) .assign(d = lambda x: x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;].ewm(span=26, adjust=False, min_periods=26).mean()) .assign(MACD = lambda x: x[&#39;k&#39;] - x[&#39;d&#39;]) .assign(MACD_S = lambda x: x[&#39;MACD&#39;].ewm(span=9, adjust=False, min_periods=9).mean()) .assign(MACD_H = lambda x: x[&#39;MACD&#39;] - x[&#39;MACD_S&#39;]) .drop([&#39;k&#39;,&#39;d&#39;], axis = 1) .tail(365) .pipe(macd_plotter, ax[1]) .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;1w&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax[0]) ) [ax[0].spines[i].set_visible(False) for i in [&#39;bottom&#39;]] [ax[1].spines[i].set_visible(False) for i in [&#39;top&#39;,&#39;bottom&#39;,&#39;left&#39;,&#39;right&#39;]] ax[1].set_xticklabels([]) ax[1].set_yticklabels([]) plt.show() . RSI . The relative strength index, or RSI is a momentum-based indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate &quot;overbought&quot; or &quot;oversold&quot; conditions in the price of a stock. RSI is displayed as an oscillator which can have a reading between 0 and 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.” . The traditional interpretation of the RSI imply that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming &quot;overbought&quot; or &quot;overvalued&quot; and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an &quot;oversold&quot; or &quot;undervalued&quot; condition, indicating the opposite. . def rsi(ser, periods = 14, ema = True): close_delta = ser.diff() # Make two series: one for lower closes and one for higher closes up = close_delta.clip(lower=0) down = -1 * close_delta.clip(upper=0) if ema: ma_up = up.ewm(com = periods - 1, adjust=True, min_periods = periods).mean() ma_down = down.ewm(com = periods - 1, adjust=True, min_periods = periods).mean() else: ma_up = up.rolling(window = periods, adjust=False).mean() ma_down = down.rolling(window = periods, adjust=False).mean() rsi = ma_up / ma_down rsi = 100 - (100/(1 + rsi)) return rsi . fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(16,9), gridspec_kw={&#39;height_ratios&#39;: [4,1]}) (df .assign(RSI = lambda x: rsi(x[&#39;Adj Close&#39;])) .tail(365) .pipe(lambda x: plotter(x, &#39;RSI&#39;, ax = ax[1])) .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq = &#39;w&#39;)) .agg(Open = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;first&#39;), High = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;max&#39;), Low = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;min&#39;), Close = (&#39;Adj Close&#39;,&#39;last&#39;), Volume = (&#39;Volume&#39;,&#39;sum&#39;)) .pipe(candle_plotter, ax[0]) ) s,e = ax[1].get_xlim() ax[1].hlines(y = [30,50,70], xmin = ax[1].get_xlim()[0], xmax = ax[1].get_xlim()[1], linestyle = &quot;--&quot;, color = [&#39;red&#39;,&#39;black&#39;,&#39;green&#39;]) ax[1].set_xlim(s,e) [ax[0].spines[i].set_visible(False) for i in [&#39;top&#39;,&#39;bottom&#39;,&#39;left&#39;,&#39;right&#39;]] [ax[1].spines[i].set_visible(False) for i in [&#39;top&#39;,&#39;bottom&#39;,&#39;left&#39;,&#39;right&#39;]] ax[1].set_xticklabels([]) ax[1].set_yticklabels([]) plt.show(); .",

Wordle requires the player to input an actual five-letter words, so it forbids random assortment of letters like prsmt or aeiou which, theoretically would be good starting words. . There&#39;s are two lists of words that you are allowed to enter in the game that are considered valid guesses. The pool of allowable entries is a little less that 13,000 words long, but these is another curated list that contains about 2,300 possible answers. These lists are actually present in the source code on the website in the order that they appear, so it is technically possible to just look up tomorrows answer, but that&#39;d be cheating. . We will pull the lists from the JS file and sort them to remove the order information. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a great way to pull a variable or array from a JavaScript file into Python, so some hacky string manipulation will have to do. . # Legacy JS url = &quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000805js_/https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/main.db1931a8.js&quot; response = requests.get(url) data = response.text #valid_entries = data.split(&quot;,Oa=[&quot;)[1].split(&quot;]&quot;)[0].replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;,&quot;&quot;).upper().split(&quot;,&quot;) #wordle_answers = data.split(&quot;var Ma=[&quot;)[-1].split(&quot;]&quot;)[0].replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;,&quot;&quot;).upper().split(&quot;,&quot;) wordle_answers = data.split(&quot;var Aa=[&quot;)[-1].split(&quot;]&quot;)[0].replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;,&quot;&quot;).upper().split(&quot;,&quot;) valid_entries = data.split(&quot;,La=[&quot;)[-1].split(&quot;]&quot;)[0].replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;,&quot;&quot;).upper().split(&quot;,&quot;) valid_entries = sorted(list(set(wordle_answers + valid_entries))) wordle_answers = sorted(wordle_answers) print(f&quot;There are {len(wordle_answers)} possible answers in Wordle&quot;) print(f&quot;There are {len(valid_entries)} possible words that can be entered in Wordle&quot;) .

We have to choose a starting word to begin the game. After we hit enter with our first guess, hidden information is revealed about the secret word using the letters of our submission. All five of our letters will change color based on if the letters are present in the hidden word. . . If our letter turns green, it means that the letter is present in the hidden word and in the correct position. Yellow means that the letter is in the word, but in the incorrect position. Gray means that the letter is not in the hidden word at all. . To begin with our analysis, we can create a function that returns the color sequence for a particular combination of words. We can start by generating a list of n length with each of the spaces representing a white space. The function will then check the position of each of the letters between two words of the same length. If the letters match up, it will overwrite the white space with a green space. If the letter is present in the word, but the positions don&#39;t match, it will overwrite the white space with a yellow space. . def indices(arr:list, value:str) -&gt; list: &quot;&quot;&quot;A function that takes in a list and a string and returns a list of index positions within the input list Args: arr (list): List to pull the index values from item (str): String to search for in the input list Returns: list: list of index positions of item &quot;&quot;&quot; return [ind for ind, x in enumerate(arr) if x == value] def color_sequence(guess:str, answer:str, emoji=True) -&gt; str: &quot;&quot;&quot;A function that takes returns a color sequence of a guess based on a predetermined answer Args: guess (str): The guess for the game answer (str): The answer for the game emoji (bool): True Returns a string of green, yellow and white square emojies False will return letters G,Y, and W Returns: str: Color sequence &quot;&quot;&quot; guess = list(guess) answer = list(answer) # Start with all spaces absent colors = [&quot;W&quot;] * (len(answer)) # If correct for ind, (g_letter, a_letter) in enumerate(zip(guess, answer)): if g_letter == a_letter: colors[ind] = &quot;G&quot; guess[ind] = &quot;&quot; answer[ind] = &quot;&quot; # If present for ind, (g_letter, a_letter) in enumerate(zip(guess, answer)): if g_letter != a_letter and g_letter in answer and g_letter != &quot;&quot;: g = indices(guess, g_letter) a = indices(answer, g_letter) if not any(i in g for i in a): colors[ind] = &quot;Y&quot; answer[answer.index(g_letter)] = &quot;&quot; colors = &quot;&quot;.join(colors) if emoji: colors = (colors .replace(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;🟩&quot;) .replace(&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;🟨&quot;) .replace(&quot;W&quot;,&quot;⬜&quot;)) return colors .

There is a special mechanic for duplicate letters. If a guess contains duplicate letters but the answer only has one of the letters, the first letter in the guess will appear yellow and the second will appear white. If there are two duplicate characters and they are both misplaced, they will both appear yellow. The same goes for combinations of matching and present characters. We can verify our function returns the correct values for the the following guess HELLO when the answer varies in the number of Ls. . print(&quot;Game Mechanics for Duplicate Letters&quot;) print(f&quot; H E L L O&quot;) print(&quot;HYDRO&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;HYDRO&quot;), &quot;No L&#39;s&quot;) print(&quot;HAZEL&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;HAZEL&quot;), &quot;One L: misplaced&quot;) print(&quot;GOLEM&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;GOLEM&quot;), &quot;One L: correct&quot;) print(&quot;NOBLE&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;NOBLE&quot;), &quot;One L: correct&quot;) print(&quot;LLAMA&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;LLAMA&quot;), &quot;Two L&#39;s: both misplaced&quot;) print(&quot;ALLEY&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;ALLEY&quot;), &quot;Two L&#39;s: one correct, one misplaced&quot;) print(&quot;TROLL&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;TROLL&quot;), &quot;Two L&#39;s: one correct, one misplaced&quot;) print(&quot;JOLLY&quot;, color_sequence(guess = &quot;HELLO&quot;, answer = &quot;JOLLY&quot;), &quot;Two L&#39;s: both correct&quot;) .

Calculating the Entropy . Now, we can generate a list of words that match the sequence we recieve from the game. This won&#39;t always be very helpful. We may get stuck in a loop of possible answers, which a common way to fail the game. For example, if we use SPARK and get the 🟩⬜🟩🟩⬜ sequence, we get back several possible answers. . reduced_corpus = get_words_using_sequence(&#39;SPARK&#39;, &quot;🟩⬜🟩🟩⬜&quot;, wordle_answers) print(reduced_corpus) . [&#39;SCARE&#39;, &#39;SCARF&#39;, &#39;SCARY&#39;, &#39;SHARD&#39;, &#39;SHARE&#39;, &#39;SMART&#39;, &#39;SNARE&#39;, &#39;SNARL&#39;, &#39;STARE&#39;, &#39;START&#39;, &#39;SWARM&#39;] . Instead of trying each of the possible answers, we can use a turn to reduce the amount of possible answers. For example, THYME would be a great word to use in this case. All but two of the possible answers will have unique sequences which we can use to narrow down the answer much faster in a much more repeatable way. . print(&quot; T H Y M E&quot;) for word in reduced_corpus: print(word, color_sequence(guess = &quot;THYME&quot;, answer = word)) . T H Y M E SCARE ⬜⬜⬜⬜🟩 SCARF ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ SCARY ⬜⬜🟨⬜⬜ SHARD ⬜🟩⬜⬜⬜ SHARE ⬜🟩⬜⬜🟩 SMART 🟨⬜⬜🟨⬜ SNARE ⬜⬜⬜⬜🟩 SNARL ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ STARE 🟨⬜⬜⬜🟩 START 🟨⬜⬜⬜⬜ SWARM ⬜⬜⬜🟨⬜ . We can use this principle on all the the available words to find which one fits the best. Since we have the complete list of possible entries for Wordle, we can now iterate through the list, finding how many different combinations of sequences there are for each word and counting how many times each sequence occurs. Using that information, we can calculate the probability of each sequence occuring and also calculate the entropy that each sequence returns. . Entropy in this case is a measure of how far we reduce the possible pool of answers. It can be calculated by taking the log-base 2 of the percentage of answers given that are possible for a given sequence. . $$ I(E) = log_2 left( frac{1}{p(E)} right) $$For example, if we use the word PIZZA as a starting word, which would instictually be a bad starting word due to the double Zs, and get ⬜⬜⬜🟩⬜, we reduce our possible pool of answers from 12,972 to 25. That provides an entropy value of 9.02 bits. . BONZE, BOOZE, BOOZY, CLOZE, COOZE, CROZE, DOOZY, FEEZE, FORZE, FROZE, FURZE, FURZY, GLOZE, GONZO, HEEZE, JEEZE, KUDZU, LEEZE, NEEZE, NUDZH, TOUZE, TOUZY, TOWZE, TOWZY, WOOZY . If instead, we got a more likely response of ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜, we would reduce our pool of answers by a little over half, from 12,972 to 4,145. . def count_of_combos(guess:str, answers:list, sort = False, probability = True, verbose = False) -&gt; dict: &quot;&quot;&quot;A function that takes in a list and a string and returns a list of index positions within the input list Args: guess (str): A string to compare all the answers against answers (list): A list containing all possible combinations of answers sort (bool): False Sorts the return dictionary by value probability (bool): True Converts the values in the dictionary to a probability Returns: list: list of index positions of item &quot;&quot;&quot; results_dict = {} increment_value = 1 if probability is True: increment_value /= len(answers) for ans in answers: seq = color_sequence(guess, ans) if seq in results_dict: results_dict[seq] += increment_value else: results_dict[seq] = increment_value if sort: results_dict = dict(sorted(results_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)) return results_dict . word = &quot;PIZZA&quot; word_combinations = count_of_combos(word, valid_entries, probability=True, sort = True) print(f&quot;Data for Each Color Combinations for the Word {word} n&quot;) print(f&quot;{&#39;Sequence&#39;:^12} {&#39;Count&#39;:&lt;8} {&#39;%&#39;:&lt;5} {&#39;Bits&#39;} &quot;*3) for ind, (key, value) in enumerate(word_combinations.items(), start = 1): print(f&quot;{key}| {round(value*len(valid_entries)):&lt;5}|{f&#39;{value*100:.2f}%&#39;:&gt;6s}| {f&#39;{np.log2(1/value):.2f}&#39;:&gt;5s}&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) if ind % 3 == 0: print() .

The painbow is a color gradient created by Randall Munroe created as a joke attempt to break every rule about visual designs.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
