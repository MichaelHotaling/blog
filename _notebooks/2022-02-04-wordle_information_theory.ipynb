    "> [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) has gone pretty viral in the last couple months. It's a very simple game where you have to guess a five letter word within six guesses. Each guess reveals some information about what letters are in the word and in what positions. The faster you get the word, the better your score. \n",

The pool of allowable entries is a little less that 13,000 words long, but these is another curated list that contains about 2,300 possible answers. These lists are actually present in the source code on the website in the order that they appear, so it is technically possible to just look up tomorrows answer, but that'd be cheating. \n",

    "To begin with our analysis, we can create a function that returns the color sequence for a particular combination of words. We can start by generating a list of n length with each of the spaces representing a white space. The function will then check the position of each of the letters between two words of the same length. If the letters match up, it will overwrite the white space with a green space. If the letter is present in the word, but the positions don't match, it will overwrite the white space with a yellow space. "
